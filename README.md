# WorkShopETL

This project implements a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** flow to simulate a recruitment process, transform it into a **Dimensional Data Model (DDM)** in a Data Warehouse, and generate **KPIs with visualizations**.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Justification of the Dimensional Data Model (DDM)

A **star schema** was used, where:

- **Fact Table â†’ FactHiring**  
  Contains the recruitment process event, with the key metrics.  
- **Dimension Tables** describe the analysis contexts (candidate, technology, year, seniority, and country).

### ðŸ”¹ FactHiring
- HireID (PK)  
- CandidateID (FK)  
- TechnologyID (FK)  
- YearID (FK)  
- SeniorityID (FK)  
- CountryID (FK)  
- CodeChallengeScore  
- TechnicalInterviewScore  
- YOE (Years of Experience)  
- Hired (boolean)

### ðŸ”¹ Dimensions
- **DimCandidate** â†’ descriptive data of the candidate (name, email).  
- **DimTechnology** â†’ applied technologies.  
- **DimYear** â†’ application year.  
- **DimSeniority** â†’ seniority level (Junior, Senior, etc.).  
- **DimCountry** â†’ candidateâ€™s country.  

ðŸ‘‰ This allows analyzing the recruitment process metrics from multiple perspectives.

---

### 6. Average Scores
Average scores in the **Code Challenge** and the **Technical Interview**.  
ðŸ‘‰ Each bar includes a label with the exact value.

### 7. Hire Rate (%) by Seniority
Proportion of candidates hired compared to the total number of applicants, by seniority level.

---

### 8. Hires (volume) + Hire Rate (%) by Seniority
Combined chart that shows:  
- **Blue bars:** number of hires (absolute volume).  
- **Red line:** Hire Rate (%) by seniority.  

This allows comparing **quantity** and **efficiency** in a single chart.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python** â†’ ETL and visualization generation.  
- **Pandas & SQLAlchemy** â†’ data transformation and loading.  
- **MySQL** â†’ Data Warehouse.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â†’ visualizations.  

---

## ðŸ“‘ Consolidated Report
All visualizations are also available in a **single PDF**:  

ðŸ“‚ `visualizations_output/report.pdf`

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusions
- The dimensional model allows analyzing hires from multiple perspectives.  
- The KPIs reveal differences between hire volumes and success rates by technology, year, seniority, and country.  
- The combined analysis (volume + Hire Rate) provides deeper insights into the **efficiency of the recruitment process**.
